 Problem Statement:
 In many educational organisations, daily operations such as admissions, student progress tracking, staff management, and communication are often handled manually or through different disconnected systems. This creates several challenges like delays in processes, lack of transparency for students and staff, and difficulties in managing large amounts of data. Without proper automation, tasks such as approvals, notifications, and report generation consume more time and effort.
Moreover, the absence of a single digital platform leads to communication gaps between students, teachers, and administrators. These issues highlight the need for a centralized and automated system to make educational management more efficient and reliable.

Objective: 
The project aims to develop a system for schools and colleges to manage admissions, student details, and academic progress, making the entire process quick, paperless, and user-friendly.
